The wagering requirement calculator is made to help casino players calculate the bonus wagering requirement before claiming it.

== Description ==
The wagering requirement calculator is created for online casino players who want to claim casino bonuses but are afraid of the potential bonus playthrough amount. Wagering requirements of a bonus can lead to negative experience with the casino. Thus, players may not get their winnings from the bonus. The calculator helps to prevent problems with withdrawal of bonus winnings by calculating the exact wagering amount a player must bet. The calculator comprises two types of bonus: match deposit bonus and free bonus.
For the right use of the plugin, an external JavaScript file at https://casinobest.ca/wp-content/plugins/mga/js/mga-calc.js is used. The JavaScript file processes the data users type in the 
calculator at the moment of use, but the data isnâ€™t further kept in a specific storage file.
